# Angular Testing Workshop

This is the sample project for the Angular testing workshop. 

The sample project includes an Angular web application and a mock RESTful API within an Nx workspace by NRWL. The Angular application uses the state and data libs to manage state and handle server communication. The state lib is built around NgRx so that the application is entirely reactive. 

## Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Node.js and NPM â€“ we recommend using [NVM (Linux/Mac)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [NVM-Windows (Windows)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
- Install Angular CLI via `npm i -g @angular/cli`

## Web: Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/onehungrymind/angular-testing-workshop.git
cd angular-testing-workshop
yarn
npm run serve:all
```

The `serve:all` command is a convenience methods that runs the other commands concurrently. You can run each command separately if you need to. 

```
"serve:web": "ng serve --open",
"serve:api": "json-server server/db.json",
"serve:all": "concurrently \"npm run serve:api\" \"npm run serve:web\" \"npm run serve:mobile\""
```

The web application will open to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

You can see the API by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@workshop-reactive-angular/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
